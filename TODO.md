### Investigations
- get id after insert discussion:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1316952/sqlalchemy-flush-and-get-inserted-id

## TODO:
    - add task comments feature
    - consider adding raw tasks (for piping)
    - status for the project should be started when some of the project task started
    - consider adding create status feature (to me it looks more to not add it)
    - add ignorecase checks to unique updates and creates

## Features to add
- [1] Add comment feature
- [3] Search task by includes. It has to be included into display features.
- [3] Show project tasks
- [3] Show tasks by tag
- [2] Add status change commands (status-start-task, status-remove-task, etc)
- [10] Consider adding full path handling for the long description

## Important: investigate this approach: 
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41270319/how-do-i-query-an-association-table-in-sqlalchemy
- need to revisit, and understand it more
- c - stands for the column
